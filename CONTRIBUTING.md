# How to contribute

I'm really glad you're reading this, because we need volunteer developers to help this project come to fruition.

## How to get involved

Please feel free to either create an issue for a proposed edit to the package, or to help build functionality already identified in an issue. 
Since we do not want to waste your time, please do not begin to develop new functionality until we have discussed your plans. There may be a 
reason why we have not built in the functionality already.

## Testing

Before submitting a pull request, please ensure that all tests pass using `testthat::test()`  and that you have run the package checks with `devtools::check()`. 
Please address all warnings and where possible, all notes, before submitting a pull request.

## Submitting changes

Please send a GitHub Pull Request to the main branch with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)). 
When you send a pull request, we will love you forever if you include RSpec examples. We can always use more test coverage.

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."
